h1. jQuery Backstretch

Backstretch is a jQuery plugin that allows you to add a dynamically-resized background image to any page.
The image will stretch to fit the page, and will automatically resize as the window size changes.

h2. Demo

"View the demo on the project page":http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/

h2. Options

The ratio of the width/height of the image doesn't always jive with the width/height of the window. Centering (centeredX, centerY and center) makes sure the center of the image is always in view and 'clips' the outer parts of the image.

h3. centeredX

A relative point on the X-axis (range 0-1) to center the image on. For backwards compatibility, true defaults to 0.5 (center), false to 0 (left). (type=Integer, default=0.5)
Usage: {centeredX: 0.3}

h3. centeredY

A relative point on the Y-axis (range 0-1) to center the image on. For backwards compatibility, true defaults to 0.5 (center), false to 0 (top). (type=Integer, default=0.5)
Usage: {centeredX: 0.2}

h3. center

Shorthand to set centeredX and centeredY at once. This will override earlier or default settings for centeredX and centeredY. (type=Array, default=[0.5, 0.5])
Usage: {center: [0.3, 0.2]}

h3. speed

This is the speed at which the image will fade in, after downloading is complete. Integers are accepted, as well as standard jQuery speed strings (slow, normal, fast). (type=Integer, default=0)

h2. Setup

Include the jQuery library and Backstretch plugin files in your webpage (preferably at the bottom of the page, before the closing BODY tag):

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery.backstretch.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>

Note: The example above uses the Google hosted version of jQuery; there is also a jQuery source file included with this distribution, if you would like to host it yourself.

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  $.backstretch("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
</script>
</code></pre>
