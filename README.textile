h1. jQuery Backstretch

Backstretch is a jQuery plugin that allows you to add a dynamically-resized background image to any page.
The image will stretch to fit the page, and will automatically resize as the window size changes.

h2. Demo

"View the demo on the project page":http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/

h2. Options

h3. hideUntilReady

Should we show the background image as it's downloading, or wait until download is complete? (type=Boolean, default=true)

h3. speed

If hideUntilReady is set to true, this is the speed at which the image will fade in after downloading is complete. This accepts integers as well as standard jQuery speed strings (slow, normal, fast). (type=Integer, default=0)


h2. Setup

Include the jQuery library and Backstretch plugin files in your webpage (preferably at the bottom of the page, before the closing BODY tag):

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery.backstretch-1.0.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>

Note: The example above uses the Google hosted version of jQuery; there is also a jQuery source file included with this distribution, if you would like to host it yourself.

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  $.backstretch("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
</script>
</code></pre>
